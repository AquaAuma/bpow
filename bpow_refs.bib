	abstract = {The conservation and sustainable use of marine resources is a highlighted goal on a growing number of national and international policy agendas. Unfortunately, efforts to assess progress, as well as to strategically plan and prioritize new marine conservation measures, have been hampered by the lack of a detailed, comprehensive biogeographic system to classify the oceans. Here we report on a new global system for coastal and shelf areas: the Marine Ecoregions of the World, or {MEOW}, a nested system of 12 realms, 62 provinces, and 232 ecoregions. This system provides considerably better spatial resolution than earlier global systems, yet it preserves many common elements and can be cross-referenced to many regional biogeographic classifications. The designation of terrestrial ecoregions has revolutionized priority setting and planning for terrestrial conservation; we anticipate similar benefits from the use of a coherent and credible marine system.},

	abstract = {While there are many generalized schemes representing the biogeographic distribution of life in the deep sea, reviewed here, a comprehensive analysis has not been undertaken since Vinogradova, 1979, Vinogradova, 1997 for the abyssal and Belyaev (1989) for the hadal. The purpose of this paper is to propose global biogeographic provinces for the lower bathyal and abyssal benthos ({\textgreater}800m depths) in order to aid high seas management efforts. Biological samples from these depths are sparse so delineation of biogeographic provinces was initially hypothesized using oceanographic proxies, and examined with documented locations of select benthic marine species. These biogeographic provinces were first developed in 2009 via an expert consultation workshop to delineate biogeographic provinces in offshore regions – the Global Open Ocean and Deep Sea ({GOODS}) classification. We have refined the {GOODS} deep-sea classification by incorporating additional high-resolution hydrographic and organic-matter flux data for the seafloor. Water mass characteristics (temperature and salinity) and particulate organic flux to the seafloor were the strongest determinants in the final delineation of provincial boundaries. This process resulted in the delineation of 14 lower bathyal and 14 abyssal provinces. The bathyal and abyssal classifications presented here should be used with other management tools and analyses (e.g., predictive habitat modeling, seamount classifications, etc.) to help determine where marine protected areas should be placed and to minimize the negative impacts of commercial activities in the high seas.},

	abstract = {The {GEBCO}\_2020 Grid is a global continuous terrain model for ocean and land with a spatial resolution of 15 arc seconds. In regions outside of the Arctic Ocean area, the grid uses as a base Version 2 of the {SRTM}15\_plus data set (Tozer, B. et al, 2019). This data set is a fusion of land topography with measured and estimated seafloor topography. Included on top of this base grid are gridded bathymetric data sets developed by the four Regional Centers of The Nippon Foundation-{GEBCO} Seabed 2030 Project. The {GEBCO}\_2020 Grid represents all data within the 2020 compilation. The compilation of the {GEBCO}\_2020 Grid was carried out at the Seabed 2030 Global Center, hosted at the National Oceanography Centre, {UK}, with the aim of producing a seamless global terrain model. Outside of Polar regions, the gridded bathymetric data sets were supplied as sparse grids by the Regional Centers, i.e. only grid cells that contain data were populated. These sparse grids were included on to the base grid without any blending. The data sets supplied in the form of complete grids (primarily areas north of 60N and south of 50S) were included using feather blending techniques from {GlobalMapper} software. The {GEBCO}\_2020 Grid has been developed through the Nippon Foundation-{GEBCO} Seabed 2030 Project. This is a collaborative project between the Nippon Foundation of Japan and the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans ({GEBCO}). It aims to bring together all available bathymetric data to produce the definitive map of the world ocean floor by 2030 and make it available to all. Funded by the Nippon Foundation, the four Seabed 2030 Regional Centers include the Southern Ocean - hosted at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Germany; South and West Pacific Ocean - hosted at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand; Atlantic and Indian Oceans - hosted at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University, {USA}; Arctic and North Pacific Oceans - hosted at Stockholm University, Sweden and the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping at the University of New Hampshire, {USA}.},
